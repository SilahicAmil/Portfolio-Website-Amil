          I've been intrigued by technology ever since I was young. I was the IT
          before the IT guy, whenever the internet would go down or family had
          computer issues I was the one to fix it.

          I am a Self Taught Web Developer, thanks to Udemy. I first started
          with Colt Steele's "The Web Developer Bootcamp". Learning the ins and
          outs of Web Development. As well as enrolling in Udemy Pro learning
          the, "AWS Certified Developer" course. For which I am now certified
          in! Since then I have kept up my skills and improving day by day.

          I'm quietly confident, naturally curious, and always working on
          improving my skills one bug at a time. I believe with time and
          experience, I'll be able to become the best version of myself I can be
